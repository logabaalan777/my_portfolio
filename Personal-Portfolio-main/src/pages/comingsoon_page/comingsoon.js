                                        This study describes a method to help visually challenged people perform daily tasks.
                                        The main purpose of this device is to help visually challenged people to a safe and convenient
                                        solution to overcome their obstacles. The project aims for flexibility, affordability, portability,
                                        simplicity in design, and practicality for the user. The proposed system uses the ultrasonic sensors
                                        which is used to identify the userâ€™s problems, identify them by processing images, and set alarms via a
                                        Bluetooth-enabled audio output device. This approach allows users to discuss issues more easily and safely.
